--[ (Complete) FM-Station

----[ Overview

	This implements the full FM-Stereo and RDS (including TMC) modulation in
software. The only thing you need is a very basic FM-modulator (mono) attached
to your soundcard. The card should be capable of at least 96kHz playback for
fm-stereo or 192kHz if you also like RDS capabilities, 192kHz is strongly
recommended for everything. In case you wonder what it actually does just
see signal.png. To get a more robust RDS reception the RDS signal is a little
stronger than local regulations allow but no impact on stereo quality was
audible so far. Also remember to shield your modulator properly to get the
best quality possible out of it.

----[ Usage

	See fmstation.sh script to get an idea. The program expects 192kHz stereo
float samples on stdin and outputs 192kHz mono float samples on stdout. Make
sure you set AUDIODEV to "hw:0,0" or whatever suits your system, without the
soundcard won't do more than 48kHz or so. If something is wrong in your
playback chain stereo will be detected by a receiver but won't be there
and/or RDS won't work. 

	To change stuff like RDS/TMC-information you have to change the source...
...for now ;)

----[ TODO

	* transform quick hack into nice code ;)
	* simpler RDS configuration
	* ...
